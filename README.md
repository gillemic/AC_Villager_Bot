# AC_Villager_Bot

A simple discord bot used for requesting information about specific villagers in ANimal Crossing: New Horizons. Currently, the commands
are 'birthday', 'personality', 'species', 'catchphrase', and 'image/picture'. Sending 'bio' will send all of this information at once.

bot can be invoked with `villager [command] [villager name]`

'birthday', 'personality', 'species', 'catchphrase' can include multiple villagers, but 'image' and 'bio' can only include one villager
